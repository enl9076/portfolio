## About
I'm a Research Psychologist with a strong foundation in experimental design, data analysis, and cognitive science — paired with practical programming skills that help me turn complex data into meaningful insights.

With experience in both academic and applied research settings, I specialize in designing behavioral studies, building custom experimental tools, and analyzing large datasets using Python, R, and statistical modeling techniques. I enjoy bridging the gap between psychological theory and real-world application, whether through user experience research, data-driven behavioral interventions, or automating research workflows.

When I’m not crunching data or coding experiments, I’m exploring app and game development with Python or integrating code with hardware using Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
